# Full Text Search Setup
This guide is intended to provide instructions for configuring full text search on Census Reporter. Broadly speaking, there are three levels of complexity to be aware of when setting this up: the database, the API, and the front end.

## Database Setup
We create a shared metadata table, `search_metadata` that indexes information about both profiles and tables. The SQL script that creates this is found in `census-api/full-text-search/metadata_script.sql`. Before we run this, we want to make simple configuration changes that add support for abbreviations. For instance, a user searching "Saint Louis" should be able to find "St. Louis."

Refer to the instructions in [abbreviations.md](abbreviations.md) to configure the thesaurus. Following that, build the search table by running
	psql census < metadata_script.sql
Note that this may take a while, because it indexes all of the place names.

**Notes**: This script requires the presence of `tiger2019.census_name_lookup`, `acs2019_1yr.census_column_metadata`, and `census_tabulation_metadata`. It does not access any other tables. It will likely need to be modified if these tables are not present or to index tigeer data from other years, 3 year data, etc.

Finally, we want to add topic pages to the `search_metadata` table. This is done via a Python script that scrapes the live topic pages off Census Reporter, `topic_scraper.py`. Run `python topic_scraper.py` to scrape and add the topic pages to `search_metadata`.

Note: If you re-run `metadata_script.sql`, you _must_ re-run `topic_scraper.py`  in order for the topic results to continue appearing. Part of `metadata_script.sql` deletes the old table to refresh it, which means the topic entries are deleted as well.

## API Setup
Fortunately, very little setup for the API is required. The version of `census-api/census_extractomatic/api.py` in the branch `full-text-search` contains the necessary functions in `full_text_search`. The API can be run locally and found at the route `/2.1/full-text/search`. For example, run
	python census_extractomatic/api.py
and query it directly as
	http://0.0.0.0:5000/2.1/full-text/search?q=puerto rico
to view results.

## Frontend Setup
Finally, as before, little is required for the front end. The necessary files can be found in `censusreporter/censusreporter/apps/census/static/js/search-results.js`, `.../census/static/js/full-text.search.js`, `.../census/templates/search/results.html`, and `.../census/templates/full_text_search.html`.

It is also necessary to point the API towards the locally running version. To do this, go to `censusreporter/censusreporter/config/base/settings.py` and update the line with `API_URL`
	API_URL = 'http://0.0.0.0:5000'
(and optionally comment the old one). Run censusreporter locally with
	python manage.py runserver
and find the full text search at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/full-text-search/`.
